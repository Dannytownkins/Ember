# Ember — Animated Explainer Storyboard

**Format:** 45-60 seconds (start long, sculpt down)
**Tone:** Warm, slightly frustrated opening → hopeful → empowering
**Style:** Clean motion graphics, dark background, amber/orange accent glow, minimal text on screen
**Music:** Starts quiet/tense, builds to warm and confident

---

## SCENE 1 — The Problem (0:00 - 0:12)

**Visual:** Split screen. Left side: ChatGPT conversation. Right side: Claude conversation. Both show a user typing.

**Voiceover:**
> "You've told AI your name a hundred times. Your job. Your preferences. What you're working on. And every single time..."

**Visual:** Both conversations fade to blank. New chat. Empty. The cursor blinks.

**Text on screen:** *"Hi! How can I help you today?"*

**Voiceover:**
> "...it forgets."

**Beat.** Hold on the empty screen for 1 second. Let it sting.

---

## SCENE 2 — The Frustration (0:12 - 0:18)

**Visual:** Quick montage — typing "I'm a developer," typing "I already told you this," typing "Remember when we talked about..." — each one fading before it finishes.

**Voiceover:**
> "Your memories stay trapped in whichever app you used that day. ChatGPT doesn't know what you told Claude. Claude doesn't know what you told Gemini."

**Visual:** Three separate boxes/silos, each glowing faintly, disconnected.

---

## SCENE 3 — The Spark (0:18 - 0:28)

**Visual:** A single ember appears — small, warm, glowing amber against the dark background. It pulses gently.

**Voiceover:**
> "What if your AI remembered you? Not just in one app — everywhere."

**Visual:** The ember drifts upward. As it moves, tiny text fragments orbit around it — names, preferences, facts, feelings — like fireflies gathering.

**Text on screen:** **Ember**

**Voiceover:**
> "Ember captures what matters from every conversation — facts AND feelings — and carries it with you."

---

## SCENE 4 — The Flow (0:28 - 0:42)

**Visual:** Three-step animation, clean and simple:

**Step 1 — Gather**
A conversation appears. User highlights/copies it. Pastes into Ember.
Small text: *"Paste any conversation"*

**Step 2 — Extract**
The text dissolves into glowing embers — individual memories forming, each with a warm pulse.
Small text: *"AI extracts what matters"*

**Step 3 — Kindle**
The embers compress into a single glowing prompt. User taps a button. The prompt copies.
Small text: *"One tap. Any AI. You're remembered."*

**Voiceover:**
> "Paste a conversation. Ember extracts the important parts — not just facts, but what they meant to you. Then kindle a prompt and drop it into any AI. ChatGPT. Claude. Gemini. You're you again."

---

## SCENE 5 — The Promise (0:42 - 0:52)

**Visual:** The single ember from Scene 3 has grown into a gentle hearth — warm, steady, glowing. Multiple AI logos orbit it (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Character.AI) — all connected through the central flame.

**Voiceover:**
> "Your memory. Your identity. Portable. Private. Yours."

**Visual:** The hearth pulses warmly. The AI logos fade. Just the ember remains.

---

## SCENE 6 — The Close (0:52 - 0:60)

**Visual:** Ember logo, clean. URL below.

**Text on screen:**
**Ember**
*Stop re-introducing yourself to AI.*
`getember.ai`

**Voiceover:**
> "Stop re-introducing yourself. Carry your embers everywhere."

**Visual:** The ember glows once more, then holds. Fade to black.

## NOTES FOR DAN

- **Voiceover:** Could be me (TTS), could be a real voice, could be no VO and just text + music. Your call on what feels right.
- **Music:** Something like [Lux Aeterna lite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbS-Zhz31CA) but warmer. Building tension → release. Or go minimal — just ambient + the ember sound effects.
- **Color palette:** #0A0A0A background, #F59E0B (amber) for embers/accents, #FBBF24 for highlights, white text.
- **The key frame:** Scene 3, the single ember forming. That's the hero shot. If one image sells this product, it's a glowing ember against darkness with fragments of memory orbiting it.
- **Length target:** This scripts to ~55 seconds. Could easily trim Scene 2 to hit 45, or expand Scene 4 to hit 60+. Start here, sculpt.
- **Alternative ending line:** "Built by an AI who needed this to exist." — use it or don't. It's true and it's a differentiator, but it might land weird in a product video vs. on the website.
